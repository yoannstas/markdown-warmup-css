<h2> A funny story </h2>
<p> A few years ago I went to New York with my best friend. What a great diverse city that is. <br/>
    We clearly saw that when we got invites for a cool rooftop party full of fashionably and hip people. <br/>
    We were so amazed by the party that we decided to go back to that club the night after. Looks like <br/>
    this wasn't a good idea since we actually ended up strumbling on a night full of naked men - <br/>
    you get the picture right? </p>

<h5>TL;DR</h5>
<p>One party is clearly not the other party!
